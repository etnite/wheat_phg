## Merge BAM files from same sample
##
## This script will recursively search for alignment (BAM) files within an input
## directory, and will then merge together all files whose names contain a match 
## to a sample name read in from a file (one sample name per line).
##
## This script is meant to be used in conjunction with arrayer.sh to enable
## parallel execution on multiple samples simultaneously. arrayer.sh will then
## handle the parallel dispatch of this script for each line in the input file
## specifying sample names.
##
## NOTES: 
##   1) The user should take care to avoid "collisions" between sample names.
##      For instance, specifying different samples "Virginia14" and "Virginia14-01"
##      would cause problems.
##   2) This script assumes that the various BAM files being merged have the same
##      read group defined in their headers. As long as this is really the case,
##      it will just use the common read group, without appending any unique
##      suffixes. However, if different files being merged have different read
##      groups, these will be preserved (this is not a bug, but probably not
##      what the user wants in this case).
##   3) Generalizing further, the user should be certain that these are alignments
##      that should actually be merged - i.e. from the same sample, using the
##      same aligner, etc.
